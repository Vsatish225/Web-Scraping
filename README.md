# Web-Scraping
scraping data from website
Web scraping is a technique used to collect large amounts of data automatically using a programming script. This makes it useful for many professionals such as data analysts, market researchers, SEO specialists, business analysts, and academic researchers.
# Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
First, import the necessary libraries: Requests for making HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content (if you don't already have it installed from the previous step), and CSV for saving the data.
# Step 2: Define the Base URL and CSV Headers 
Set the base URL for the dataset listings and define the headers for the CSV file where the scraped data will be saved.
# Step 3: Create a Function to Scrape Dataset Details 
Define a function scrape_dataset_details that takes the URL of an individual dataset page, retrieves the HTML content, parses it using BeautifulSoup, and extracts relevant information.
# Step 4: Create a Function to Scrape Dataset Listings
Define a function scrape_datasets that takes the URL of a page listing multiple datasets, retrieves the HTML content, and finds all dataset links. For each link, it calls scrape_dataset_details to get detailed information.
# Step 5: Loop Through Pages Using Pagination Parameters
Implement a loop to navigate through the pages using pagination parameters. The loop continues until no new data is added, indicating that all pages have been scraped
# Step 6: Save the Scraped Data to a CSV File
After scraping all the data, save it to a CSV file.
# Step 7: Run the Scraping Function
Finally, call the scrape_uci_datasets function to start the scraping process.
# Conclusion
Once you become familiar with the methods used in this script, you can explore techniques like proxy management and data persistence.You can also familiarize yourself with other libraries like Scrapy, Selenium, and Puppeteer to fulfill your data collection needs.
